,Lack will get his turn now to prove he can put up quality numbers with a starter's workload. The 27-year-old ended up playing exactly half the schedule last season, first serving as Luongo's backup, and then the starter after Luongo was traded to the ,. Again Lack finds himself in a situation where he can run with a No. 1 role. The early results have been good: since relieving Miller in the game he was injured against the Islanders, Lack has made 67 saves on 68 shots faced in 98:47 of ice time. That's a per-60-minute average of over 41 shots, and despite the stiff workload, Lack has been nearly perfect.

,It's certainly a situation in flux for Anaheim when it comes to goaltending, but for the time being Gibson is the starter and playing quite well. Recalled after , was placed on injured reserve, Gibson quickly usurped , on the depth chart, and after a shaky opening appearance in which he relieved Bryzgalov, has gone 4-3-0 with a .914 save percentage. His save percentage would be higher if not for two ugly games against the , and , in which he got little help. Andersen is still out, and coach , will have a difficult decision to make once he's healthy. At some point though, it was always going to be Gibson's time.

,Vermette (31% owned) is a faceoff specialist who can contribute in a top-six role and with the man advantage. , is far from a given to remain among the Blackhawks' top six forwards, considering he hasn't scored a goal since Jan. 11 (21-game drought). With , struggling and , sidelined, Vermette could stave off his own struggles and provide a fresh look for Chicago down the stretch. He played alongside Sharp and , in his debut Monday and was on the ice for one Blackhawks goal and one allowed. If he's as productive as he was earlier in the season, he could get those two goal-scorers on track and see a splash of the results.
